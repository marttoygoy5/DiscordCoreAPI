# DiscordCoreAPI
My bot library/framework, written in C++ using WinRT!
## Roadmap
Alright, so I'm currently working on getting this thing to be "useful", and here are some of the things I plan on implementing:

-Finish adding the base Discord-API data structures, along with classes to utilize/access/change their values.

-Add a "music-listening" layer, with a usable "voice channel" that includes audio encoding/decoding.

-Build a few bots with the library and document examples.

If you have any suggestions, feel free to let me know and I will consider taking you up on it! Thanks!
