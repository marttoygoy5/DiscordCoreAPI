### **Adding/Creating a Slash Command:**
---
- Create a `DiscordCoreAPI::CreateApplicationCommandData` data structure.
- For each argument, fill out an `ApplicationCommandOptionData` structure, and push it back into the options member of the `CreateApplicationCommandData` structure. (**IMPORTANT #1**: Notes on which kind of types to set can be found [here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/slash-commands#subcommands-and-subcommand-groups)) (**IMPORTANT #2**: Be sure to set the order of the arguments up to be equivalent to what they are in the normal version of the command, so that they can be parsed properly.)
- Run, from the `DiscordCoreClient` instance, the `slashCommands::createGlobalApplicationCommandAsync()` function. (Note: This is done from within a command called `registerslashcommands`, by default.)

```cpp
DiscordCoreAPI::CreateApplicationCommandData createTestCommandData;
createTestCommandData.defaultPermission = true;
createTestCommandData.description = "A test command.";
createTestCommandData.name = "test";
DiscordCoreAPI::ApplicationCommandOptionData testCommandOptionOne;
testCommandOptionOne.name = "optionone";
testCommandOptionOne.required = true;
testCommandOptionOne.type = ApplicationCommandOptionType::STRING;
testCommandOptionOne.description = "The first argument to be entered.";
createTestCommandData.options.push_back(testCommandOptionOne);
args->eventData.discordCoreClient->slashCommands->createGlobalApplicationCommandAsync(createTestCommandData).get();
```
